Purpose of the Thread Group:
This Thread Group simulates user behavior for the product search functionality on the e-commerce website. It tests the performance and response time of search queries under load.

User Load Details:
- Number of Threads (Users): 100
- Ramp-Up Period: 60 seconds
- Loop Count: 10

Test Scenario:
1. User navigates to the homepage.
2. User logs in using credentials from CSV file.
3. User performs a product search with a keyword.
4. User views search results.
5. User logs out.

Key Metrics to Monitor:
- Search query response time.
- Error rate during login and search.
- Throughput of search requests.

Special Configurations:
- CSV Data Set Config for parameterizing login credentials.
- HTTP Cookie Manager to manage session cookies.
- HTTP Cache Manager to simulate browser caching behavior.

Assumptions and Preconditions:
- Users have valid login credentials in the CSV file.
- The search functionality is operational and indexed.

Expected Outcomes:
- Search response time should be less than 2 seconds for 95% of requests.
- Error rate should be below 1%.

Dependencies:
- This Thread Group depends on the User Setup Thread Group to initialize user accounts and data.

Mail Topic Name : Cucumber BDD framework with Rest Assured API Testing.

I would like to inform you that, as per mentioned below topics, I need to start R&D first, After that, I will begin practicing on the configuration of creating and designing a framework from scratch using the BDD approach with Cucumber, Selenium Java programming languages.

Based on the topics listed below, I need to create a document and submit it to our live drive's practice folder.



Approx Time : 30 April (If I have to provide work on tasks throughout the whole day, there might be a few days' delay, but I will do my best to complete them as soon as possible and provide updates.)

Here, I have mentioned two main topics: Theoretical and Practical.
